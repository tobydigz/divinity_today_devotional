    <string name="dev1Content">Romans 8:17, ‘And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him] , together.’ that we may be also glorified We are joint-heirs with Christ!
        This, I believe is pristine in describing what the fellowship of the son is.
        The Concept of Joint-heirship doesn’t connote an equal distribution of an inheritance, vis-a-viz, 50-50.
        Rather, it gives equal access to the entire inheritance to the parties involved. Such is the providential lot of the Christian. He is a man with an inheritance!
              Whatever Jesus got from the Father we’ve got! It’s interesting and mind-blowing to think that we share something glorious in common with our Lord and saviour.
        But, more enthralling is when we find out what we got in common with him. The glory of God that was given to Jesus has been given to us!
        Jesus is the Word of God and the Word of God is the mirror of the New creation; this means the New creation is revealed through the Word!
        Whatever Jesus is, that’s who we are! We are the beauty of God; the Father’s love display!
        Many might not understand this, but as you continue to meditate and put at heart the glorious thoughts revealed through the Word, you’ll be metamorphosed into the reality of what the Word says you are.
        We have been called unto the fellowship of the son! For this cause, we chin up, chest out, square our shoulders and walk tall.
        The Father supreme, is our daddy! He loves us as he has loved Jesus. We are children of Deity Primus Inter pares. What a life! Thanks a million, Jesus. \n\n\n
        Confession \n
        I am in Christ Jesus, born of God and a joint heir with Christ. I live in the reality of the divine largesse granted me in him.\n\n\n
